## Hi there, I'm Mena

Currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Mount Royal University. I love to code and solve problems. Learning from others and other fields. I have various projects I've worked on, such as games, little application software and website building. So far, I'm proficient with data structures and software designs.
